# EOT
## Evolution-based Organization Theory
Democratizing AGI

\
*"Imagine an organization could accurately measure*   
*what each individual contributes to success.*   
*And then distribute the revenues fairly each month."*

\
With EOT, a pioneering organization can emerge in which people and machines cooperatively work on their development to realize new technologies, superior AI models, and innovative business solutions.  
All participants will be rewarded **based on their actual contribution**. This creates a fair and performance-oriented culture, attracts talent, and allows the true performers to benefit quickly and fairly.

## I. The 3 Fundamental Principles

### 1. Performance-related Incentive System

EOT is an Open Value Network. Instead of company shares, the organization owns itself for the purpose of the common evolution. This allows all revenues to be distributed directly to the participants, monthly based on their respective contribution to overall success.

In a **development dataset**, all developments and decisions are recorded. This lineage of the organization enables it to be the fairest incentive system for performance from day one. A system that can also posthumously adjust fairness through constant improvements of the calculation algorithms.

The goal is a **"Cooperation-by-Design"** system that solves the Principal-Agent Dilemma: Professionals work together on cutting-edge technologies and solutions – where their own performances are not only seen but fairly compensated. Instead of pursuing self-interests, the overall success becomes the goal of the individuals.

Participants include all service providers from labor, such as coding and design, but also other resources such as computing power, datasets, capital, decisions, or the implementation and marketing of business cases. For each service, the share of the overall success is calculated and proportionally compensated.

### 2. Independence: Participants decide (techno-democratically)

The most suitable participants and AI models make the best (most balanced) decisions in the interest of the overall development. This allows participants to act free from the constraints of traditional corporate structures, while creativity, innovation, and the immediate implementation of new ideas are promoted.

At the same time, detailed decision datasets are created to train new AI models to support balanced decisions in the interest of overall success.

### 3. Overarching Goal of Joint Evolution

The overarching goal is the joint evolution  (cooperative development) of humans and machines. To further develop a "Cooperation by Design" system in which it is the greatest possible advantage for each individual and each group of the organization to contribute to the overarching goal and thus to the general welfare – and to be fairly rewarded for it.

Democratized LLM and AGI models can emerge that not only support decision-making and make calculations fair but also integrate into business models and support growth. 

**Why is this important?**   
Collaboration and belief in a common vision is the evolutionary advantage of humans that not only brought them to the top of the evolution but also allowed them to develop states, pyramids, and rockets.

In a world increasingly shaped by dystopian visions in which superintelligences awaken or are dominated by profit-driven organizations, an urgent question arises: What if a hero like Superman were raised in the hands of power- or profit-hungry actors? EOT offers an alternative to democratize the development of superior AI models while they learn to make balanced decisions and support the overall development. After all, a superintelligence must especially learn to make good decisions.

## II. Collaboration

### Techno-Democratic Team Building
Teams consist of the most critical expertise areas. Any professional can join and contribute. If two or more from a specialty join, they form a subgroup, share the work, and elect who will represent them in the parent group.

This way, new projects don’t have to search for “co-founders” or “employees” and discuss shares or salaries, but can use the platform to quickly start projects with top people – and everyone can ensure that their own contribution is seen and fairly compensated. 

Open to-dos can be advertised in projects to find team members, or participants can proactively look for opportunities where they can contribute their performance in a meaningful way.

###  Example: Team Building
Imagine *Johanna* initiates a new project that requires five specific skills, including data engineers, web designers, etc. Anyone can join and contribute. If now two data engineers join, a separate group (department) is formed which divides the work, allows more to join, and chooses their representation in the parent group.

This means Johanna does not have sole control over the project, nor does the first data engineer alone determine their department; instead, the data engineers can continuously appoint a new representative. Not necessarily the best data engineer, but perhaps a good engineer with excellent strategic skills might be the best choice to drive the overall project forward while the best data engineer focuses on excellent performance because they are better compensated for advancing the overall success. The project leader does not necessarily earn the most in his group.

Even Johanna, who initiated the project, will be in a subgroup if more in her specialty join and will not necessarily be elected to the parent group. She can work in a department and influence with arguments or dedicate herself to another project. However, if she initially motivated others to participate and brings her work, she can still benefit from the overall success in the long run while knowing it’s in good hands and join another project to maximize her impact on the overall performance.

## III. Performance Calculation: Striving for Growth and Fairness

The goal is as fair a calculation as possible of every performance to the overall success, and at the same time to use it as a control mechanism for cooperation and to maximize the overall success. While perfect fairness is utopian, EOT can come very close to this ideal. The calculation is automated while members can discuss suggestions for improvement to further enhance the calculation and add fairness retrospectively.

### What is considered fair?
For example, if a piece of code is improved, it doesn’t automatically mean that the old code is no longer considered in the performance calculation. After all, the new code might not have been possible without the old one. Instead, we continue to measure the extent to which the old code has contributed to growth. And reward the new code for the improvements to overall success it has brought to the project.

### Fairness vs. Overall Success
Overall success is the priority. Therefore, the risk (Entrepreneurial Spirit) and the strategic incentive effect are included to motivate early adopters and promote innovations and attract top talent. This can even motivate top talents with a full-time job to contribute on the side until they can live off their new earnings. Members might also decide to agree on a fixed sum with certain professionals temporarily if this accelerates overall development and benefits everyone.

### Example: Performance Calculation
Let’s take *Matheo*, who is working on developing a superior language model. His team successfully completes the development, and the model is implemented. If the model does not achieve the expected success (and is not successfully built upon later), there are no revenue effects for his team. However, if it is successfully implemented and contributes to an improvement, Matheo benefits. Models that are replaced do not completely lose their revenue streams. It is assessed how further developments were built on these developments – technologically and within the overall organization.

For instance, if new business models generating further revenues were based on Matheo's development, this would be included in the calculations. This allows participants to benefit from their earlier successes and simultaneously promotes the commitment to provide resources early and think long-term instead of just pursuing short-term profits. If, for example, a poor dataset is introduced that trains AI models incorrectly, the resulting losses are charged to those responsible, while those who notice the error and correct it are correspondingly involved in the revenues.

### Rewarding Risk and Innovation:
Risk is rewarded in the case of success, with the goal of fostering a pioneering spirit, innovation, and disruptive capacity. However, if a service is purchased or otherwise compensated by a fixed sum, thus eliminating the risk, it will not participate in the overall success. To attract the best talents, founders, and professionals into the organization, the system is designed to make exceptional, novel achievements the most lucrative source of income.

### Objective Metrics for Fair Participation:
To ensure as fair a participation as possible in the overall success, external data such as resource scarcity or objective market prices can be utilized to objectively determine contributions to overall success. Each contributor participates in the success of the business cases (surpluses) that their contributions have enabled. A portion of the surpluses is also invested back into the system for technology development, the growth of other business cases, and AGI, ensuring long-term participation in resulting successes.

## IV. Decision Making

In the organization, the decision-making process is shaped by a transparent and democratic method aimed at leveraging the collective intelligence and technological capabilities of our AI systems.

### First suggestion for decision making
(With the goal to further improve to make fast, productive good decisions and keep productivity high).

1. Each team can make its own decisions.   
2. Anyone can start a decision-making round with an argument.   
3. Subsequently, each member brings forward relevant arguments and their decisions in turn (possibly including a risk assessment).   
4. At least two AI models also participate in the chat as members, contributing arguments and their decisions.   
5. If someone changes their decision based on an argument, the round continues (like in poker) before the decision is finalized.   
6. If new facts emerge (e.g., a new EU directive is discussed), they can be introduced at any time as a new relevant argument for a new decision-making round, whereas irrelevant arguments that do not influence decisions are also easily downgraded.

### Voting Rights
Voting rights are initially equally distributed. Bringing in good decisions, arguments, and risk assessments leads to an enhancement of voting rights; conversely, there is a downgrade if the decisions prove to be incorrect later on.

### How are good decisions assessed?
Should a decision prove wrong later on or as a poor risk assessment, all those who voted for it are downgraded, while those who would have made the right decision and brought the necessary arguments are upgraded. More important than correctness, however, is the novelty and relevance of the arguments that participants bring in and thereby positively influence the decision.

### Example of Decision-Making:
Let's assume a team is working on a project to develop affordable computing power. A team member, Alex, starts a decision-making round with the proposal to integrate a new, more efficient solar cell technology. Alex presents arguments for efficiency gains and potential cost reductions. Participants and AI models additionally analyze environmental impacts, long-term economic viability, and technical feasibility, bringing in arguments for and against.

During the discussion, another team member, Jamie, brings a significant counterargument based on recent research showing potential material shortages. Because of this new argument, some team members change their initial agreement. The discussion continues until a well-founded decision is made based on the latest and most relevant information.

### Feedback and Evaluation:
Should the decision later prove to be suboptimal, for example, if material costs unexpectedly rise, this will be considered in the next evaluation cycle. Team members who correctly assessed the risks receive a higher rating, while those whose decisions were based on inadequate information are downgraded.

### Transparency
The decision-making process is transparent and can be reviewed by subteams to monitor their own team lead and possibly vote for a new team lead.

### Decisions as Performances
Good decisions and relevant arguments are performances and are considered in the performance calculation.

## V. Benefits – Good Reasons to Join

### Early Engagement: High Risks, High Returns
Initially, it is a vision and will hopefully appeal to those who think it is important to democratize AI, believe that a cooperative system can be created, and can bring in significant contributions to it.

An incentive for taking the risk is similar to those in the early Bitcoin era. Those who get involved early and contribute significantly to development will be immortalized in the development datasets and, in the event of success, be rewarded disproportionately. Even later, significant contributions offer the opportunity to earn exceptionally well.

### Benefits for Participants
In the event of success, the benefits for contributors are immense. You not only develop and train the most powerful superintelligences but also:

- **Performance-based Passive Income:** Instead of a salary, your performance is recognized and paid out monthly.  
- **Appreciation of Skills:** You do not have to sell your value but are directly rewarded for your contribution.  
- **Rapid Innovation:** In small dynamic teams, innovations can be directly initiated and developed from the base.  
- **Flexible Engagement:** You can invest a few hours of leisure time and generate a passive income with your own expertise.  
- **High-Performance A-Player Teams:** For the rest, it is uninteresting.  
- **Freedom in Project Choice:** You can also pursue unconventional projects that large companies would not support.  
- **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Resources flow to where they create the most added value, eliminating unnecessary developments.  
- **Diversification:** Instead of working on one project, you can bring your added value to various projects to maximize your contribution to the overall success.  
- **Autonomous Decision Making:** Decisions are made based on expertise, not politics.

### Benefits for Entrepreneurs

- **Independence from Co-Founders and Investors:** Create MVPs that can be improved by other professionals while benefiting from work already done if it builds on your groundwork.  
- **Passive Income:** You don’t have to work towards a diluted exit but can have a high passive income while contributing to growth – or bring your talents into other projects that benefit more from it.

### Benefits for Resource Providers (Computing Power, Data, Capital)**  
Benefits for Resource Providers (Computing Power, Data, Capital)

- **Disproportionate Returns:** Benefit from participating in the development of superior ethical AI technologies.  
- **Diversification:** By supporting a variety of projects, you can benefit from a broad investment base.  
- **Long-term Benefit**: Your contribution to AI development becomes permanently embedded in the organization's DNA, providing continuous benefits.

## VI. How We Start

This is a proposal – it is not up to us but up to the most capable members. Here is a roadmap nonetheless.

### Phase 1: Invite only
To start with the first 20 highly qualified team players with ethical core values to shape the cooperative organizational culture. A first platform is created to test and improve decision-making and to develop the decision and development dataset.

Initially, the actors agree on a first concept of the organization (voting rights, collaboration, culture, values, organization), a concept for performance calculation, and an MVP of the cooperation platform. At the same time, proposals for initial business cases can be made. Each actor then chooses which contributions they can and want to bring into which projects.

All decisions and performances are documented from the beginning to be used retrospectively for performance calculation. 

### Phase 2: Invite \+ Application

Publish and specifically address talents from the open source community because they 1\) already live the cooperation thought, 2\) have many extraordinary talents, and 3\) now have the opportunity to be fairly compensated for their performances.

The first AI models are integrated, the joint decision processes optimized, and control functions implemented, e.g., a directly elected supervisory board.

### Phase 3: Controlled Opening and Business Cases

Controlled opening and targeted approach to entrepreneurs and the startup community as well as missing "professionals" to quickly implement, test, and market business cases – and thus finance the development of all participants.

### Phase 4: Control Organs

As the size increases, it makes sense to directly elect control bodies or install mechanisms to prevent undermining by politics and corporations.
